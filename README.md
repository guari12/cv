# Computer Vision
## Description
An artificial vision program for the recognition and classification of fruits. Both algorithms Kmeans and Knn will be programmed in order to determine which is the best for this task. In the following image you can see the image processing.

### Improvements 
In this project I implemented a hybrid kmeans algorithm, since I combined it with a simulated annelling. The objective of this algorithm is to improve the performance of the kmeans algorithm because, as we already know, this algorithm depends on the initial values, so with the simulated annelling and with the correct choice of an energy measure we can use it to choose a better seed and improve results.
