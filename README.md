# Computer Vision
## Description
An artificial vision program for the recognition and classification of fruits. First, the different fruit images from a database will be processed. From this processing, through opencv, we will obtain different parameters from each image. With the information obtained from all the parameters of the training set, 2 classification algorithms Kmeans and Knn will be programmed in order to determine which is the best for this task. 
### Improvements 
In this project I implemented a hybrid kmeans algorithm, since I combined it with a simulated temper. The objective of this algorithm is to improve the performance of the kmeans algorithm because, as we already know, this algorithm depends on the initial values, so with the simulated temper and with the correct choice of an energy measure we can use it to choose a better seed and improve results.
